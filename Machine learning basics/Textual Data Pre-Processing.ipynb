Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.

With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled Rodgers\\u2019 promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N. F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team\\u2019s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks\\u2019 title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the   Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas, Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. \\u2019s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17\\u2019s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team\\u2019s quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the team\\u2019s   running back, they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami\\u2019s middling defense, even if Tannehill\\u2019s knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins\\u2019 plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the team\\u2019s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs\\u2019   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr\\u2019s backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.\",\n          \"  David Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

What Keeps the F-35 Alive By David Swanson on October 31, 2016 Petition to Stop F-35 Going Global \\nby David Swanson \\nImagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away. However, where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones, lower reading skills, poorer memories, impaired auditory and speech perception, and impaired academic performance. \\nMost of us would find this situation at least a little concerning, unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then it\\u2019d be just fine. \\nNow, imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldn\\u2019t safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again, I think, we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. \\nImagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes, emitting highly toxic chemicals, particles, and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally, that\\u2019d be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people, we\\u2019ll work with its flaws, won\\u2019t we? \\nNow, what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1,400,000,000,000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education, healthcare, housing, environmental protection, or humanitarian aid? Wouldn\\u2019t that be a worry in some cases, I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasn\\u2019t at stake? \\nWhat if this product, even when working perfectly, was a leading destroyer of the earth\\u2019s natural environment? \\nWhat if this high-tech toy wasn\\u2019t even designed to do what was expected of it and wasn\\u2019t even able to do what it was designed for? \\nAmazingly, even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then, all is forgiven. \\nThe tool I\\u2019m describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link you\\u2019ll find explanations of how the tool I\\u2019ve been decribing is the F-35. \\nThe petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington, Vermont, and Fairbanks, Alaska, where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition, Save Our Skies Vermont, Western Maine Matters, Alaska Peace Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club, North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, RootsAction.org, Code Pink, and Ben Cohen. \\nThe petition reads: \\nThe F-35 is a weapon of offensive war, serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year, it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending, contrary to popular misconception, also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. \\nWars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law, diplomacy, aid, crisis prevention, and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore, we, the undersigned, call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole, and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers\\u2019 pockets, and into environmental and human needs in the U.S., other F-35 customer nations, and around the world, including to fight climate change, pay off student debt, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and improve education, healthcare, and housing. \\nAdd your name . \\nDavid Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macy\\u2019s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macy\\u2019s about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday. Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy\\u2019s, the country\\u2019s biggest department store, which has been struggling. Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macy\\u2019s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg. Once a retail titan, Macy\\u2019s has struggled to remain relevant as   and discount retailers have decimated the traditional    business. Last month, Macy\\u2019s announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close some of its 880 stores. Terry Lundgren, its chief executive and the architect of Macy\\u2019s last big merger, is expected to step down by the end of March. He will be succeeded by the company\\u2019s president, Jeffrey Gennette. Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins. Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom. That has been particularly difficult for Macy\\u2019s, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of   retailers like HM nor the   stores. In addition, Macy\\u2019s faces increasingly fierce competition online from sites like Amazon and elsewhere. Macy\\u2019s troubles have drawn the attention of a prominent activist hedge fund, Starboard Value, which has urged the company to generate cash by selling the real estate beneath its stores. Starboard, which held just under 1 percent of Macy\\u2019s shares as of Sept. 30, had previously estimated the value of that land at about $21 billion. On Friday, analysts at Citigroup estimated that Macy\\u2019s   holdings could be worth at least $18 billion. Macy\\u2019s market value, by comparison, was just under $11 billion as of Friday morning. Macy\\u2019s has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including     deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back. The company\\u2019s suitor, Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company, is far smaller  \\u2014   its market value was about 1. 9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1. 5 billion  \\u2014   but is known for its bold steps. Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudson\\u2019s Bay department store chain, Lord  Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks. And the governor and executive chairman of the Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company, Richard Baker, has shown little fear of using debt: In November 2014, the company borrowed nearly $4 billion against the Saks flagship in Midtown Manhattan. He has spoken often of retailers\\u2019 need to highlight the value of their real estate. Financing a bid for Macy\\u2019s may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6. 5 billion in   debt. That may mean that the Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings. A spokesman for the Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company declined to comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. \\u201cWe do not comment on rumors and speculation,\\u201d a representative for Macy\\u2019s said. A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment. Some analysts said that they saw the merit of a potential combination, particularly given Macy\\u2019s operational woes and Mr. Baker\\u2019s expertise in wringing money out of real estate. \\u201cThere is a clear logic, despite disparity in   cap\\u201d between Macy\\u2019s and Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company, Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, said in a note. Referring to Macy\\u2019s stock ticker symbol, he added, \\u201cThe retail market has been changing faster than M has been able to keep up with, whether the flight from the mall or the migration online. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news_data.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6Pr8lVkXeEkS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714924584147,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Prithvi Raj","userId":"07551708717361774535"}},"outputId":"ec5433e4-4312-4b3c-da5a-1c64b66aba81"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(20800, 5)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news_data['label'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jWcVmELneHS4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714924760460,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Prithvi Raj","userId":"07551708717361774535"}},"outputId":"eee444b6-dba1-4bba-b34a-51fffbaed2ab"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["label\n","1    10413\n","0    10387\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# checking for missing values\n","news_data.isnull().sum()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XdeN6ctaeyas","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714924945126,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Prithvi Raj","userId":"07551708717361774535"}},"outputId":"7f6c722a-d26b-4182-9164-27b162284c03"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["id           0\n","title      558\n","author    1957\n","text        39\n","label        0\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# replacing missing values with null string\n","news_data = news_data.fillna('')"],"metadata":{"id":"m11ST7ZvffiT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714925164640,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Prithvi Raj","userId":"07551708717361774535"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# checking for missing values\n","news_data.isnull().sum()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Aip27GUrgKTv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714925172505,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":488,"user":{"displayName":"Prithvi Raj","userId":"07551708717361774535"}},"outputId":"1a0be06f-644b-4a4d-b6d6-f47665cec413"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["id        0\n","title     0\n","author    0\n","text      0\n","label     0\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# merging the author name and news title\n","news_data['content'] = news_data['author'] + ' ' + news_data['title']"],"metadata":{"id":"676RB5CEgOTd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714925425730,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":732,"user":{"displayName":"Prithvi Raj","userId":"07551708717361774535"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news_data.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":275},"id":"y3JuteC_hAkz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714925429289,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1619,"user":{"displayName":"Prithvi Raj","userId":"07551708717361774535"}},"outputId":"b0e40a54-f4cc-4ef4-bcad-ff02673fb004"},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id                                              title              author  \\\n","0   0  House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Let...

This western-organized \\u201cliberation\\u201d of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that I\\u2019ve seen. Islamic State (IS), the defender of Mosul, is a paper tiger, blown out of all proportion by western media. IS is, as this writer has been saying for years, an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents, religious fanatics, and modern-day anarchists. At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience. These former officers of Saddam Hussain are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader. But IS rank and file has no military training, little discipline, degraded communications, and ragged logistics. In fact, today\\u2019s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term, \\u2018bashi-bazouks,\\u201d a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture, rapine, looting, and arson. What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature, lack of \\u00e9lan , and hesitancy. In my view, ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syria\\u2019s government \\u2013 just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both were cultivated to split the PLO. ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world. Western and Kurdish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year. Instead, western \\u2013 mainly US \\u2013 warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime. Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria. Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad. Don\\u2019t be fooled. IS has only 3-5,000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa, maybe even less. The leaders of IS are likely long gone. IS has few heavy weapons, no air cover at all, and poor communications. Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly. Encircling Mosul are at least 50,000 western-led soldiers, backed by heavy artillery, rocket batteries, tanks, armored vehicles and awesome air power The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish peshmerga fighters, Iraqi army and special forces, some Syrian Kurds, Iranian \\u2018volunteers\\u2019 irregular forces and at least 5,000 US combat troops called \\u201cadvisors\\u201d, plus small numbers of French, Canadian and British special forces. Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops, supported by armor and artillery ready to \\\"liberate\\\" Iraq \\u2013 which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. For the US, current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialist\\u2019s fondest dream: native troops led by white officers, the model of the old British Indian Raj. Washington arms, trained, equips and financed all its native auxiliaries. The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma. To be a political movement, it was delighted to control Iraq\\u2019s second largest city. But as a guerilla force, it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded. This is what\\u2019s happening right now. In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees, ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power, as the recent 1967, 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown. Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover. IS forces would best advise to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks. Otherwise, they risk being destroyed. But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics, IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa. When this happens, western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS.   LewRockwell.com . Related\",\n          \"The   at the Democratic National Committee after an embarrassing breach of its email system continued on Tuesday with the departure of three senior officials. Amy Dacey, the committee\\u2019s chief executive Luis Miranda, its communications director and Brad Marshall, its chief financial officer, will leave amid a reshuffling of leadership positions, said Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman. The departures came more than a week after WikiLeaks posted almost 20, 000 of the committee\\u2019s emails, a number of which revealed officials showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton in her primary campaign against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The messages confirmed the concerns expressed by Mr. Sanders throughout the campaign, cast a cloud over the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week and led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as the committee\\u2019s chairwoman. Ms. Brazile praised the outgoing staff members and made no mention of the controversy. \\u201cThanks in part to the hard work of Amy, Luis, and Brad, the Democratic Party has adopted the most progressive platform in history, has put itself in financial position to win in November, and has begun the important work of investing in state party partnerships,\\u201d she said in a statement. \\u201cI\\u2019m so grateful for their commitment to this cause, and I wish them continued success in the next chapter of their career. \\u201d American intelligence officials believe that the Russian government was behind the breach of the committee\\u2019s emails and documents, possibly as part of an effort to damage Mrs. Clinton and sow discord in the Democratic Party. An email from Mr. Marshall to Mark Paustenbach, a communications official, and Ms. Dacey suggesting that the committee promote questions about Mr. Sanders\\u2019s faith drew particular scorn from the senator and his supporters. \\u201cIt might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God,\\u201d Mr. Marshall wrote, referring to Kentucky and West Virginia. \\u201cHe had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. \\u201d In May, Mr. Paustenbach wrote to Mr. Miranda about encouraging reporters to write that Mr. Sanders\\u2019s campaign was \\u201ca mess\\u201d after a glitch on the committee\\u2019s servers gave the Sanders campaign access to the Clinton campaign\\u2019s voter database. \\u201cWondering if there\\u2019s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess,\\u201d Mr. Paustenbach wrote.

This western-organized \\u201cliberation\\u201d of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that I\\u2019ve seen. Islamic State (IS), the defender of Mosul, is a paper tiger, blown out of all proportion by western media. IS is, as this writer has been saying for years, an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents, religious fanatics, and modern-day anarchists. At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience. These former officers of Saddam Hussain are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader. But IS rank and file has no military training, little discipline, degraded communications, and ragged logistics. In fact, today\\u2019s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term, \\u2018bashi-bazouks,\\u201d a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture, rapine, looting, and arson. What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature, lack of \\u00e9lan , and hesitancy. In my view, ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syria\\u2019s government \\u2013 just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both were cultivated to split the PLO. ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world. Western and Kurdish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year. Instead, western \\u2013 mainly US \\u2013 warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime. Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria. Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad. Don\\u2019t be fooled. IS has only 3-5,000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa, maybe even less. The leaders of IS are likely long gone. IS has few heavy weapons, no air cover at all, and poor communications. Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly. Encircling Mosul are at least 50,000 western-led soldiers, backed by heavy artillery, rocket batteries, tanks, armored vehicles and awesome air power The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish peshmerga fighters, Iraqi army and special forces, some Syrian Kurds, Iranian \\u2018volunteers\\u2019 irregular forces and at least 5,000 US combat troops called \\u201cadvisors\\u201d, plus small numbers of French, Canadian and British special forces. Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops, supported by armor and artillery ready to \\\"liberate\\\" Iraq \\u2013 which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. For the US, current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialist\\u2019s fondest dream: native troops led by white officers, the model of the old British Indian Raj. Washington arms, trained, equips and financed all its native auxiliaries. The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma. To be a political movement, it was delighted to control Iraq\\u2019s second largest city. But as a guerilla force, it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded. This is what\\u2019s happening right now. In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees, ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power, as the recent 1967, 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown. Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover. IS forces would best advise to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks. Otherwise, they risk being destroyed. But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics, IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa. When this happens, western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS.   LewRockwell.com . Related\",\n          \"The   at the Democratic National Committee after an embarrassing breach of its email system continued on Tuesday with the departure of three senior officials. Amy Dacey, the committee\\u2019s chief executive Luis Miranda, its communications director and Brad Marshall, its chief financial officer, will leave amid a reshuffling of leadership positions, said Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman. The departures came more than a week after WikiLeaks posted almost 20, 000 of the committee\\u2019s emails, a number of which revealed officials showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton in her primary campaign against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The messages confirmed the concerns expressed by Mr. Sanders throughout the campaign, cast a cloud over the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week and led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as the committee\\u2019s chairwoman. Ms. Brazile praised the outgoing staff members and made no mention of the controversy. \\u201cThanks in part to the hard work of Amy, Luis, and Brad, the Democratic Party has adopted the most progressive platform in history, has put itself in financial position to win in November, and has begun the important work of investing in state party partnerships,\\u201d she said in a statement. \\u201cI\\u2019m so grateful for their commitment to this cause, and I wish them continued success in the next chapter of their career. \\u201d American intelligence officials believe that the Russian government was behind the breach of the committee\\u2019s emails and documents, possibly as part of an effort to damage Mrs. Clinton and sow discord in the Democratic Party. An email from Mr. Marshall to Mark Paustenbach, a communications official, and Ms. Dacey suggesting that the committee promote questions about Mr. Sanders\\u2019s faith drew particular scorn from the senator and his supporters. \\u201cIt might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God,\\u201d Mr. Marshall wrote, referring to Kentucky and West Virginia. \\u201cHe had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. \\u201d In May, Mr. Paustenbach wrote to Mr. Miranda about encouraging reporters to write that Mr. Sanders\\u2019s campaign was \\u201ca mess\\u201d after a glitch on the committee\\u2019s servers gave the Sanders campaign access to the Clinton campaign\\u2019s voter database. \\u201cWondering if there\\u2019s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess,\\u201d Mr. Paustenbach wrote. Mr. Miranda wrote back: \\u201cTrue, but the Chair has been advised to not engage. So we\\u2019ll have to leave it alone. \\u201d The committee has since apologized to the Sanders campaign. To help fill the void, the committee announced, it is bringing on Tom McMahon, a former executive director of the committee, to lead a transition team.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20412,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Wrenfoe Fellated by a dead pig?
